This user has access to:

- An **internal research** platform.
- A **chat tool** used by the firm.
- A **portfolio management system**.
- A **charting tool**.
- A **market data terminal** which gives news, quotes, research management, etc.

## Workflow 1 


1. The user is reading a new report about IBM published on the **market data terminal**.
2. The user links the **market data terminal **with the **charting app **so that whatever stock is shown in the **market data terminal ** is also shown in the **charting tool.**   
3. While they read the report on IBM, the **charting tool** shows a real-time graph of the share price of IBM.

## Workflow 2

1. While reading the report the user wants to look up what the firmâ€™s internal analysts have written about the company. The user opens the** internal research app **and links it to show a view of the same stock that the **market data app** and **chart **are showing. 
2. The research app changes to show IBM research.

3. A note from one analyst is intriguing so the user wants to know more. The user hovers over the name and launches the chat tool with a conversation with the analyst in focus.  Some details regarding the note have already been added to the chat for context.

4. The user decides to link the **portfolio management **app to the others.  It updates to show the position on the IBM stock.  Now, four applications are synchronized together.

## Workflow 3

1. The user decides they want to go and look at a competitor of IBM: Oracle.  They change the **Market Data** app to bring the ORCL stock into view. 

2. The four applications all change together to show the information about the ORCL stock instead.
