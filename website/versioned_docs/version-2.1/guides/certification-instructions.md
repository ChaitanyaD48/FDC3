**Note 1**:  The FCFP exam is _proctored_ - this means someone will be observing you (via webcam) take the exam.  For this reason, scheduling the exam is slightly complex.  These instructions will take you through the process.

**Note 2**: While it should be possible to schedule your exam from within a firewalled financial services firm, we strongly suggest to avoid technical difficulties, taking this exam **on your own equipment** outside office hours.

If you **complete** the exam, you'll receive some **FINOS swag** (a t-shirt) and the **FCFP Qualification** to share on socials.

      <p>Next, you should see a greyed-out schedule box.  The exam is run by another firm, <a href="https://www.psiexams.com/test-sponsors/test-delivery/online-proctoring/">PSI</a>, and it can take up to 30 minutes to get the details of the candidate over to them.  So the button to schedule remains greyed out for usually a few minutes. </p>

      <p>As mentioned above, try to schedule the exam for a time when you'll be on your home equipment as it may not work inside a firewall.</p>
